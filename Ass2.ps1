#  Check that Windows Defender antimalware toolkit is enabled.

#  AntiSpywareEnable is telling if the spyware component is enabled or not
#  AntivirusEnabled lists if the antivirus compnent is enabled or not
#
#
#  To check all the status' I will store their data in variables and call on them to compare if they are true or false
