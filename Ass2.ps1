#  Check that Windows Defender antimalware toolkit is enabled.

#  Will need to check MpComputerStatus to see if windows defender tools are enabled
#  AMRunning mode is the status of the windows defender, enabled, passive or disabled etc.

#  AntiSpywareEnable is telling if the spyware component is enabled or not

#  To check all the status' I will store their data in variables and call on them to compare if they are true or false

Create a software inventory that is a list of approved programs. Check that only
approved programs are installed. Submit your list of approved programs. Remove one of
the approved programs from your list. Submit an example run of your script detecting an
unapproved program. 






Create a list of services approved for running. Check that only approved services are
running. Remove one of the approved services from your list. Submit an example run of
your script detecting an unapproved service.



5. Please implement one of the following three tasks: either part a, part b or part c. You do
not need to implement all of part a, b and c.
a. Check the Windows machine has been hardened against DNS poisoning
attempts that use failed DNS requests. That is, check the registry property
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient\EnableMulticast
is set to 0. On some computers, the key might instead be
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsNT\DNSClient\EnableMulticast.
b. Check Cortana has been disabled on the Windows PC. That is, ensure that
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search\AllowCortana
is set to 0.
c. Check that the Network Time Protocol (NTP) is enabled. That is, check that NTP
Enabled of HKLM\SYSTEM\State\DateTime is set to 1.
